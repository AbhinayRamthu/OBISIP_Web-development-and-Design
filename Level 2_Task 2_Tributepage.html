    <p><strong>Albert Einstein</strong> (1879–1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (the other being quantum mechanics). His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc², regarded as "the world's most famous equation," has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation." Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect."</p>
    <p>What I admire most about Einstein is his curiosity and relentless pursuit of knowledge. He questioned everything and was never satisfied with the status quo. His groundbreaking theories revolutionized our understanding of the universe and paved the way for numerous scientific advancements.</p>
    <p>Einstein's contributions extend far beyond the realm of physics. He was also a passionate advocate for peace, civil rights, and education. His wisdom and wit continue to inspire generations of scientists, thinkers, and dreamers.</p>
    <p>Albert Einstein's legacy is a testament to the power of human imagination and intellect. He reminds us that with curiosity, perseverance, and a willingness to challenge conventional wisdom, anything is possible.</p>
